My name is Wang PiaoHong (王飘鸿 in Chinese). I am a second year Ph.D. student at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and study under the guidance of Prof. [ZhiCong Lu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/). I am currently interested in gaming, live-streaming and XR techniques. I am also a visiting member of [Immersive Design Group](https://www.seungwooje.com/home) and work closely with Prof.[Seungwoo Je](https://www.seungwooje.com/) at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). Before my Phd journey, I obtained my bachelor degree in financial technology from [South China Univerisy of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). Check all my published work [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F8QcajQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and contact me via [piaohongwang@gmail.com]().


I started exploring how to combine algorithms (e.g., SLAM, CV, and LLM) and hardware sensors with XR devices to empower users recently. I am super excited about this research direction every day.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
